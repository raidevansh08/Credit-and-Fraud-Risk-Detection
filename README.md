Predict if the applicant will default in the next 12 months from a new credit card application.

## The Business Problem
A bank can offer two types of cards:
1. Charge card: The balance is required to be paid in full each month
2. Lending card: Lending cards allow the customer to pay the balance over a period of
time subject to interest being charged
An individual can apply for any one of the two types of card on offer. To extend the
card to individuals, banks must first underwrite the applicant. Underwriting is the process
by which the lender decides whether an applicant is creditworthy and should receive a credit
line. Along with the data in application forms, banks also have access to the consumer
bureau. Bureau is an agency that aggregates consumer borrowing and payment information to assess the creditworthiness of an individual and set a limit on the cumulative
credit that can be extended to an individual by lenders.
